F1TENTH is a 1/10th scale autonomous racecar platform that is 10x the fun! This is a hands-on course that will teach you the basics of perception, planning and control in a fun approach. Students who completed this course have gone on to pursue exciting careers in autonomous systems. This course is appropriate for seniors and graduate students.

### Build
Build an autonomous race car from scratch! Starting from a stripped-down 1/10th-scale mechanical chassis capable of 40mph, add the sensors, the compute boards, and the electronic components needed for autonomous driving. In the process you will learn about different sensing modalities, their pros and cons, PID tuning, and principles of embedded computing.

### Code
Now that you have the hardware ready, you will learn how to program an autonomous robot to turn the raw sensory data into actionable information, and ultimately into navigation and control commands for your car. Your code will leverage ROS capabilities, the widely popular OS for robotic applications. 

### Race!
Your team will compete against others for completing the track in the fastest time. In the second half of the class your team will independently develop racing algorithms that will give you the edge over the others. We will guide you in learning navigation algorithms such as pure pursuit and probabilistic roadmaps.

## Topics Covered
Topics include: self-driving hardware, Robot Operating System, Electronic Speed Control, localization, scan matching, PID control, mapping, SLAM, racing lines, local and global path planning, neural networks-based autonomous cars, visual feature extraction, visual localization, autonomous transportation systems, and moral decision making.

## Grading Policy
- 8 Directed Labs (50% in total)
- 3 Races and Public Communication (30% in total)
- Final Race Documentation (5%)
- Peer Review (5%)
- Participation and TA Evaluation (10%)

## Pre-requisites
The most important technical pre-requisite is good programming skills in C++ and Python. You will be coding or reading code in both languages. You will also need knowledge of frequency transform concepts (e.g., Fourier or Laplace), basic matrix algebra and differential equations.
