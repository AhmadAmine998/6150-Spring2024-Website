The goal of this course is to give students an up-to-date foundation in the technologies being deployed and tested on self-driving cars, and more general autonomous mobile systems. 

## Topics Covered
Topics include: self-driving hardware, Robot Operating System, Electronic Speed Control, localization, scan matching, PID control, mapping, SLAM, racing lines, local and global path planning, neural networks-based autonomous cars, visual feature extraction, visual localization, autonomous transportation systems, and moral decision making.

## Grading Policy
- 8 Directed Labs (50% in total)
- 3 Races and Public Communication (30% in total)
- Final Race Documentation (5%)
- Peer Review (5%)
- Participation and TA Evaluation (10%)

## Pre-requisites
The most important technical pre-requisite is good programming skills in C++ and Python. You will be coding or reading code in both languages. You will also need knowledge of frequency transform concepts (e.g., Fourier or Laplace), basic matrix algebra and differential equations.
